The paper presents a solution to the challenges posed by complex deep CNNs in computer vision tasks. The paper introduces the Shallow Convolutional Neural Network (SCNNB).
The SCNNB offers an efficient alternative, utilizing batch normalization for quicker training convergence and accuracy improvement. With only four layers featuring small convolutional kernels, the SCNNB maintains performance while significantly reducing complexity. Experimental results demonstrate its ability to quickly learn data features, achieving 93.69% accuracy on fashion-MNIST and 99.42% accuracy on MNIST.
